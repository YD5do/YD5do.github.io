            <p class="mb-6">Irish traditional festivals mark the turning points of the agricultural year, following the ancient Celtic calendar. Many of these celebrations have roots in pre-Christian times but were later incorporated into the Catholic tradition, creating a distinctive blend of pagan and Christian elements that persists to this day.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Marking the beginning of spring, Imbolc celebrates the increasing daylight and the first stirrings of new life. The festival was associated with the goddess Brigid, who was later Christianized as St. Brigid of Kildare. Traditional customs include:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Making Brigid's Crosses</strong> - Reed crosses woven on February 1st and hung in homes for protection</li>
                        <li><strong>Brigid's Cloak</strong> - Placing a cloth or garment outside on the eve of the festival for Brigid to bless</li>
                        <li><strong>Biddy Boys</strong> - In parts of Kerry and Cork, groups would go from house to house with a Biddy (effigy of Brigid) collecting donations and offering blessings</li>

                        <li><strong>Iron Protection</strong> - Placing iron objects near newborns to ward off fairy abduction</li>

            <p class="mb-6">Despite centuries of Christianity, Ireland retained a rich tapestry of folk beliefs that blend pre-Christian elements with Catholic practice. These beliefs often concern the interaction between the human world and supernatural forces.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Belief in the fairy folk (the Sí or Aos Sí) persisted in Ireland well into the 20th century and remains part of cultural memory today. These were not the diminutive, winged creatures of Victorian imagination but powerful, unpredictable beings who shared the landscape with humans:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Fairy Forts (Raths)</strong> - Ancient earthworks believed to be fairy dwellings and avoided by local people</li>
                        <li><strong>Fairy Thorns</strong> - Solitary hawthorn trees thought to mark fairy pathways and never to be cut down</li>
                        <li><strong>Changelings</strong> - The belief that fairies could steal human children and leave substitutes</li>
                        <li><strong>Protective Practices</strong> - Iron objects, bread, salt, and specific prayers used for protection</li>
                        <li><strong>Fairy Paths</strong> - Houses built across these invisible routes were believed to suffer misfortune</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">While active belief in fairies has declined, their cultural significance remains strong, and many people still hesitate to interfere with fairy forts or solitary thorns.</p>
