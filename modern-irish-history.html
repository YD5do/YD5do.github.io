                    <p class="mb-4">Following the Tudor conquest, the 17th century saw systematic colonization through "plantations," where Irish land was confiscated and given to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. The most significant was the Ulster Plantation (1609), which dramatically altered the demographic and cultural landscape of northern Ireland and created tensions that persist to this day.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The defeat of Catholic forces at the Battle of the Boyne (1690) led to the implementation of the Penal Laws, a series of harsh restrictions on Catholics and Dissenters. These laws prohibited Catholics from voting, holding public office, owning property, practicing their religion freely, or receiving education. Although unevenly enforced, these restrictions deeply affected Irish society and cultural memory.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Inspired by the American and French Revolutions, the Society of United Irishmen led by Wolfe Tone attempted to establish an independent Irish republic. Their 1798 Rising, though unsuccessful, represented a significant moment in Irish republican history. The brutal suppression of the rebellion strengthened British resolve to tighten control over Ireland, leading to the Act of Union in 1800, which abolished the Irish Parliament and incorporated Ireland directly into the United Kingdom.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The potato blight that struck Ireland in 1845 led to one of the most catastrophic famines in modern European history. Approximately one million people died of starvation and disease, while another million emigrated, reducing Ireland's population by about 25%. The British government's inadequate response—adhering to laissez-faire economic policies while continuing to export food from Ireland—has remained a point of historical contention and shaped Irish attitudes toward British rule.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The Famine accelerated emigration patterns that would transform Ireland into a diaspora nation. It also devastated Irish-speaking regions, accelerating language shift toward English, and fundamentally altered land ownership patterns as many small holdings were consolidated into larger farms.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The 1870s and 1880s saw significant agrarian agitation known as the Land War. Led by Michael Davitt's Land League and supported by Charles Stewart Parnell, tenant farmers campaigned against absentee landlordism through boycotts and other forms of resistance. These movements eventually led to land reform acts that allowed many tenants to purchase their farms, fundamentally altering Ireland's socioeconomic landscape.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">From the 1870s, the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Charles Stewart Parnell advocated for Home Rule—self-government within the United Kingdom. Despite coming close several times, Home Rule bills were defeated or delayed, often due to opposition from Ulster Unionists who feared Catholic domination in a self-governing Ireland. By 1914, a Home Rule bill had passed but was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I. This delay would prove fateful, as more radical nationalist movements gained momentum during the war years.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">On Easter Monday 1916, a small group of Irish republicans led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic. Though militarily unsuccessful and initially unpopular, the British execution of the Rising's leaders transformed public opinion. The Rising became a powerful symbol of Irish resistance and is often considered the birth moment of the modern Irish state.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="war-of-independence" class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">War of Independence (1919-1921)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Following the 1918 election, in which Sinn Féin won a majority of Irish seats, Irish republicans established an alternative government (Dáil Éireann) and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) began a guerrilla campaign against British forces. Under leaders like Michael Collins, the IRA's intelligence operations and flying columns proved effective against British rule. The war ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which established the Irish Free State as a dominion within the British Empire while partitioning six counties in Ulster to remain in the UK as Northern Ireland.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The Treaty's provisions, particularly the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown and the partition of Ireland, split the nationalist movement. Anti-Treaty forces led by Éamon de Valera rejected these compromises, while the Pro-Treaty government led by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith maintained they had secured the best achievable agreement. The resulting Civil War was brief but brutal, ending in victory for the Pro-Treaty forces but leaving deep political divisions that would shape Irish politics for generations.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The new Irish Free State faced immense challenges, including economic development, establishing democratic institutions, and defining national identity. Under William T. Cosgrave's government (1922-1932), the state focused on stability and economic orthodoxy. Éamon de Valera's Fianna Fáil government (1932-1948) pursued economic self-sufficiency and dismantled constitutional ties to Britain, culminating in the 1937 Constitution and the formal declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The mid-century period saw significant emigration due to economic stagnation, with Ireland remaining largely rural, conservative, and strongly influenced by the Catholic Church. The protectionist economic policies were gradually abandoned in the late 1950s, opening Ireland to foreign investment and setting the stage for later modernization.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Northern Ireland developed as a self-governing region within the UK with a built-in Protestant Unionist majority and systemic discrimination against the Catholic Nationalist minority. The civil rights movement of the 1960s sought to address these inequalities but escalated into a violent conflict known as "The Troubles" (1968-1998). This three-decade period saw paramilitaries, British security forces, and civilians caught in a cycle of violence that claimed over 3,500 lives.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">The peace process of the 1990s culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which established power-sharing institutions, cross-border bodies, and mechanisms for addressing contentious issues like policing and decommissioning weapons. Though imperfect, the agreement largely ended the violent conflict and created structures for peaceful political engagement.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">From the mid-1990s to 2008, Ireland experienced unprecedented economic growth known as the "Celtic Tiger" period. Foreign direct investment, EU funding, and technology sector expansion transformed Ireland from one of Western Europe's poorest countries to one of its wealthiest. However, a property bubble and banking crisis led to a severe recession in 2008, requiring an international bailout.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Twenty-first century Ireland has seen dramatic social changes, with referendums approving same-sex marriage (2015) and repealing abortion restrictions (2018). The influence of the Catholic Church has declined significantly amid scandals and societal secularization. Ireland has positioned itself as a global, pro-European nation, though Brexit has raised new questions about Northern Ireland's status and the future of the island's political arrangements.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Modern Irish identity has been shaped by this complex historical journey. The legacy of colonialism, famine, revolution, and reconciliation continues to influence Irish politics, culture, and self-perception. The relationship with Britain has evolved from colonial struggle to partnership within the European framework, though historical memory remains a powerful force.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">Contemporary Ireland grapples with questions of national identity in a globalized world. The Irish language, though spoken daily by a small minority, remains symbolically important as a marker of cultural distinctiveness. Traditional culture coexists with modern cosmopolitanism, creating a uniquely Irish approach to navigating between tradition and innovation.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">The island continues to navigate the complexities of partition, with growing discussion about the possibility of reunification spurred by demographic changes in Northern Ireland and the impact of Brexit. Meanwhile, the Irish diaspora—the descendants of those who left during the Famine and subsequent waves of emigration—maintains connections to Ireland through cultural practices, heritage tourism, and collaborative projects.</p>
