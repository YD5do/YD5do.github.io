            <p class="mb-6">Ireland possesses one of the oldest vernacular literatures in Western Europe, with a written tradition dating back to the arrival of Christianity in the 5th century CE. However, the oral tradition from which these texts emerged is much older, preserving mythological narratives and poetic forms that likely date to prehistoric times.</p>

                    <h3 id="mythology" class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Mythology and Epic Tales</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Early Irish literature is organized into several cycles of related tales:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>The Mythological Cycle</strong> - Stories of Ireland's supernatural early inhabitants including the Tuatha Dé Danann, featuring figures like the Dagda, Lugh, and the goddess Danu</li>
                        <li><strong>The Ulster Cycle</strong> - Heroic tales centered around King Conchobar mac Nessa and the warrior Cú Chulainn, including the epic Táin Bó Cúailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley)</li>
                        <li><strong>The Fenian Cycle</strong> - Narratives about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band, the Fianna, including the tale of his son Oisín's journey to Tír na nÓg (the Land of Youth)</li>
                        <li><strong>The Cycles of the Kings</strong> - Stories surrounding historical kings like Cormac mac Airt, blending history with mythological elements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">These narratives display remarkable literary sophistication, with complex characters, psychological depth, and innovative narrative techniques. They survived through oral tradition before being recorded by Christian scribes, who often added their own interpretations while preserving pagan elements.</p>

                        <li><strong>Illuminated Manuscripts</strong> - The Book of Kells, Book of Durrow, and Cathach of St. Columba represent high points of medieval European art</li>

                        <li><strong>Annals and Chronicles</strong> - Historical records like the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of the Four Masters</li>
                        <li><strong>Saints' Lives</strong> - Hagiographies blending historical fact with miraculous elements</li>

                <h3 id="bardic" class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Bardic Poetry</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">From the 12th to 17th centuries, a sophisticated tradition of courtly poetry flourished in Gaelic Ireland. Professional poets (filí) trained for years in specialized bardic schools, mastering complex metrical forms and an elaborate poetic language. These poets composed praise poetry for their noble patrons, satires against enemies, elegies for the dead, and political commentary on current events.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">The Flight of the Earls in 1607 and subsequent Plantation of Ulster dealt a severe blow to the bardic tradition by removing many aristocratic patrons. The final generations of bardic poets, including Dáibhí Ó Bruadair and Aogán Ó Rathaille, chronicled the collapse of the Gaelic order with elegiac power. Their work represents a bridge between medieval and modern Irish literature.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">The 18th century saw Irish writers making major contributions to English literature, often while maintaining a distinct Irish sensibility:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Jonathan Swift (1667-1745)</strong> - Dublin-born satirist whose works include <em>Gulliver's Travels</em> and <em>A Modest Proposal</em>, where he used satire to critique British policy in Ireland</li>
                        <li><strong>Oliver Goldsmith (1728-1774)</strong> - Poet, playwright, and novelist whose works like <em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em> and <em>She Stoops to Conquer</em> often drew on his Irish upbringing</li>
                        <li><strong>Maria Edgeworth (1768-1849)</strong> - Pioneering novelist whose work, including <em>Castle Rackrent</em> (1800), depicted Irish life with unprecedented realism and influenced later writers like Sir Walter Scott</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">These writers operated in a complex colonial context, often addressing English audiences while commenting on Irish conditions. Their work established a pattern of Irish writers using English as a literary language while maintaining a critical perspective on Anglo-Irish relations.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">Irish writers made significant contributions to the Gothic literary tradition, creating works that often reflected the anxieties of the Protestant Ascendancy:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Charles Robert Maturin (1782-1824)</strong> - Dublin clergyman whose novel <em>Melmoth the Wanderer</em> (1820) is considered a masterpiece of Gothic fiction</li>
                        <li><strong>Sheridan Le Fanu (1814-1873)</strong> - Master of the ghost story whose works include <em>Uncle Silas</em> and the vampire tale <em>Carmilla</em>, which predated and influenced Bram Stoker's <em>Dracula</em></li>
                        <li><strong>Bram Stoker (1847-1912)</strong> - Dublin-born author whose novel <em>Dracula</em> (1897) became one of the most influential works of horror fiction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">This Gothic tradition has been interpreted as expressing the fears of the Anglo-Irish regarding their tenuous position in Irish society, caught between the English and the native Irish population.</p>

                    <li><strong>Samuel Ferguson (1810-1886)</strong> - Poet and antiquarian who translated Irish legends into English verse, influencing the later Celtic Revival</li>
                    <li><strong>Oscar Wilde (1854-1900)</strong> - Dublin-born playwright, novelist, and wit whose works like <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> and <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> display his Irish heritage through their verbal dexterity and subversive humor</li>

            <p class="mb-6">The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a remarkable flowering of Irish literature, part of a broader cultural nationalist movement that sought to revive interest in Ireland's Gaelic heritage while creating distinctively Irish forms of English-language literature.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) emerged as the central figure of the Irish Literary Revival. His early work drew heavily on Irish folklore and mythology, helping to create an Irish literary identity distinct from English traditions. Works like <em>The Wanderings of Oisin</em> (1889) and <em>The Celtic Twilight</em> (1893) introduced international audiences to Irish mythological figures and folk beliefs.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">As his career progressed, Yeats developed a more complex relationship with Irish nationalism while continuing to draw inspiration from Irish sources. His later poetry, including masterpieces like "Easter, 1916," "The Second Coming," and "Sailing to Byzantium," combined mystical imagery with political concerns and personal reflections. Yeats received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923, the first Irish writer to be so honored.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">In 1904, Yeats, Lady Augusta Gregory, and Edward Martyn founded the Abbey Theatre, Ireland's national theater, which became a center for Irish dramatic literature. The Abbey staged works by:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>John Millington Synge (1871-1909)</strong> - Playwright whose masterpiece <em>The Playboy of the Western World</em> caused riots when first performed due to its unromanticized portrayal of Irish rural life</li>
                        <li><strong>Lady Augusta Gregory (1852-1932)</strong> - Dramatist, folklorist, and patron whose comedies and translations of Irish legends enriched the Abbey's repertoire</li>
                        <li><strong>Sean O'Casey (1880-1964)</strong> - Whose Dublin trilogy—<em>The Shadow of a Gunman</em>, <em>Juno and the Paycock</em>, and <em>The Plough and the Stars</em>—depicted working-class life during the revolutionary period</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="mb-4">James Joyce (1882-1941) emerged as one of the most revolutionary writers of the 20th century, taking Irish literature in new directions while maintaining a profound, if complex, relationship with his homeland. Though he spent most of his adult life in self-imposed exile in continental Europe, Dublin remained the setting for virtually all his major works.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Joyce's literary journey from the relatively accessible short stories of <em>Dubliners</em> (1914) to the experimental pinnacle of <em>Finnegans Wake</em> (1939) transformed both Irish literature and world literature. His novel <em>Ulysses</em> (1922), which follows Leopold Bloom through a single day in Dublin (June 16, 1904, now celebrated as "Bloomsday"), is widely considered one of the greatest novels ever written, combining psychological realism, linguistic innovation, and encyclopedic ambition.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">For a small nation, Ireland has produced an extraordinary number of writers who have shaped world literature. This achievement has been recognized with four Nobel Prizes in Literature—Yeats (1923), Shaw (1925), Beckett (1969), and Heaney (1995)—giving Ireland one of the highest per-capita rates of Nobel laureates in literature globally.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">Irish literary innovation has influenced international movements from modernism to postcolonial literature. Joyce's experimental techniques revolutionized the novel, while Yeats helped redefine modern poetry. Irish playwrights from Wilde to Beckett to Marina Carr have expanded the possibilities of theater.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4">The Irish language literature tradition continues alongside English-language writing, with authors like Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Máirtín Ó Cadhain, and Áine Ní Ghlinn creating important works in Irish. Government support for Irish-language publishing and translation has helped maintain this tradition despite the challenges faced by minority languages.</p>
